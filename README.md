## Hi, My name is Kristina!

**pronouns: she/her**

I'm currently working towards a major in Graphic Information Technology through Arizona State University. Go Sundevils! After graduation I hope to take the skills I've learned and get a job in the tech industry. 

I have very limited coding skills but I'm eager to learn :) I enjoy coding because it allows you to be creative.
